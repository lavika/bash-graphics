## Bash Graphics
Gives an visualization of your commands usage.

If you ever wonder, What all commands you use on a daily basis and their frequency(?) 

Well bash graphics not only answers this question but infact gives you a proper visualization about your commands usage like:

## Usage

Clone the repo and execute following in `bash-graphics` directory:
     
     $ ruby commands_history_chart.rb

It will read the history file of whatever shell you are using currently and will give you commands usage visualization in chrome browser.

### Note

Currently Bash graphics only supports `Chrome` and `zsh`, `bash` shells.


## Upcoming Features

* Suggest user to create an alias for frequently used long commands.

* Support for firefox and safari.

* Incorporate error handling mechanisms.


Any suggestions/features/ideas are most welcome!
